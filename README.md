[![CI](https://github.com/b-fg/b-fg.github.io/workflows/gh-pages/badge.svg)](https://github.com/b-fg/CV.tex/actions)

Static pages build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Publications list linked to my [CV.tex](https://github.com/b-fg/CV.tex) repository. Pushing changes into CV.tex master triggers the rebuild of the static pages in this repository.
Then the publications page gets updates according to the latest BibTex file in [main.bib](https://github.com/b-fg/CV.tex/blob/main/main.bib).
