Today I start a short postdoc with [Prof. Sarah Waters](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/waters/Waters/Dr_Sarah_Waters.html) at Oxford University on transport of porous particles in channel flow using immersed boundary methods.

Updated: [Here](/assets/pdf/Font_2021_Transport_of_porous_particles_in_channel_flow.pdf) is a short summary of the work done.
