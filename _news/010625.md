Chen Wang has joined the group as a PhD student. He will be working in scale-resolving simulations for ships! We will try to push the state-of-the-art of CFD in the maritime sector with wall-modelled LES and a multi-GPU solver. This project is embedded within the wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) cross-faculty effort.
