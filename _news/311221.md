After finishing my PhD, I was contacted by people from different universities to give an invited talk about CFD + ML, a hot topic indeed!

- PPPL Computer Science Department's Machine Learning lunch seminar series, Princeton University (September 2021).
- Applied Mathematics in Aerospace Engineering seminar, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain (April 2021)
- Applied Math Colloquium, University North Carolina, US (March 2021)
- Ocean Engineering, University Rhode Island, US (February 2021)
- Fluid Dynamics Group at the Institute of High Performance Computing (A*STAR), Singapore (November 2020)
