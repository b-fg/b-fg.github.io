This week I attended the [ECCOMAS 2022 Congress](https://www.eccomas2022.org/frontal/default.asp) in Oslo, Norway.
Lots of cool work but there were so many parallel sessions that it was hard to decide where to go actually.
My talk was related to the performance of classic turbulence models (WALE, Vreman) and novel ones (integral length scale approximation, ILSA) on both low-order finite volume and high-order DGSEM solvers.
