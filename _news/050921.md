The [PUMPS+AI Summer School](https://pumps.bsc.es/2022/) at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center has started this year, and I have been invited to give a lecture on CFD+ML.
Around 40 students attended the summer school and the feedback was great!
I am happy I was given this opportunity, and I am already looking forward to the next year edition.
