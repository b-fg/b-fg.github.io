This year has been truly special for me as I moved to the Netherlands about 12 months ago now as an Assistant Professor in Data-Informed CFD at TU Delft.

I have attended conferences such as ECCOMAS in Lisbon, JuliaCon in Eindhoven (really recommend this one!), and CFD+ML ERCOFTAC in Paris. I started doing some teaching, writing grants, supervising, and taking part in MSc and PhD thesis committees. Of course tons of new research, also in fields I had not worked before, which is always exciting. Overall, I just started my journey as an academic, and (thankfully) I liked it!
