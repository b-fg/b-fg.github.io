Today I was part of the defense committee of (now) Dr. Ahmed Abdellatif at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC). The thesis title is ["Heat Transfer in
Supercritical Fluids: Computational Approaches & Studies"](https://upcommons.upc.edu/entities/publication/bb3eaf20-22b1-4aaf-b653-cfde0194aa55). Congrats!
