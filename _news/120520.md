Today I finished my PhD attachment in the Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR (Singapore). It's been 2 years full of memories: good and bad, but great mostly! I'll be missing this.

Now looking forward to finishing my PhD and the next academic step :)
Also, I will be returning home to for the final thesis write-up. I hope I can enjoy some summer holiday in my hometown after submitting!
