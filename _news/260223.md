I have started supervising my first PhD student, Manuel Cabral, who will do his PhD at TU Delft.
This PhD will be co-supervisied with [Prof. Gabriel Weymouth](https://weymouth.github.io/), my former PhD supervisor, which makes this even more special.
The topic of the PhD is "Physics-based machine learning of marine hydrodynamics".
