Today I was part of the defense committee of (now) Dr. Benet Eiximeno at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC). The thesis title is ["High performance computing and artificial intelligence algorithms for dimensionality reduction of turbulent flows"](https://upcommons.upc.edu/entities/publication/e64b834f-a540-4fb3-bb69-6a316e5864b9). Congrats!
