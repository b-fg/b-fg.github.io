Yesterday I presented at the 3rd High-Fidelity Industrial LES/DNS Symposium ([HiFiLED](https://www.ercoftac.org/events/les-dns-symposium3/)) the work done at BSC for the European project [NextSim](https://nextsimproject.eu/).
We showed results of novel turbulence closures (integral length scale approximation, ILSA) on a high-order solver (DGSEM) for the JEAN subsonic nozzle.
