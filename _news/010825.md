We have published a new preprint ["SmartFlow: A CFD-solver-agnostic deep reinforcement learning framework for computational fluid dynamics on HPC platforms"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.00645). This results from a collaboration with a broad group of researchers doing active flow control with reinforcement learning.
