I am very grateful to the Dutch funding agency NWO for awarding me the VENI grant! This is an individual grant funding new high-risk/high-reward research projects for 3 years. My project is ["FastFlows: Fast scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flows through physics-based machine learning"](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme/projects-veni/veni-2024). I will explore novel blendings of ML models with established CFD methods to develop a new framework for accelerating scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flows.
