During the last few months, I have been learning about the flux reconstruction method: a high-order spectral method which combines properties from discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and spectral differences (SD) methods.
This has resulted in a new 1D solver written in Julia, [Flower1D.jl](https://github.com/b-fg/Flower1D.jl)
I am already working on the 2D version, which is only partially functional.
Hopefully I will have more time to work on this in the future ;)
