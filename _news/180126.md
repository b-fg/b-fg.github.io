Today I presented as invited speaker at the NUM-SCARS workshop at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (Amsterdam). We discussed numerical methods for scale-resolving simulations, focusing on symmetry/invariants-preserving methods, closure models, high-order, scalability, open-source and benchmarks.

I gave an invited talk about [WaterLily.jl](https://github.com/weymouth/WaterLily.jl) and the power of open-source solvers within the CFD community. My final slide summarizes the takeaways about developing and using open-source tools:
- Impact
- Control the methods
- Interact with core developers
- Transparency and reproducibility
- Give back to community
