Today I start a new postdoctoral position at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and I could not be happier! Barcelona is my hometown so this position was something I could only dream about.

I will be working with [Dr. Oriol Lehmkuhl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xM19OIAAAAAJ&hl=en) on the European project [NextSim](https://nextsimproject.eu/): Next generation of industrial aerodynamic code.
