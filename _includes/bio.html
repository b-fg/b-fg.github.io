*Welcome!* This is the **Data-Informed Computational Fluid Dynamics** (DI-CFD) group led by Dr. Bernat Font (he/his), Assistant Professor at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/b.font/).
Our main research interest focuses on exploiting data to improve current CFD methods in terms of computing, modelling, and flow control.

Some of our current projects involve:
<div markdown="1" style="list-style-type:none; margin-left:40px">
* Deep reinforcement learning for active flow control
* Scale-resolving simulations (SRS) of flows at high Reynolds numbers
* Acceleration of SRS using numerical methods enhanced with physics-based machine learning (PBML)
* Wall modelling of non-equilibrium boundary layers using PBML
* Discovery of partial differential equations from raw data using ML and sparse regression
* [WaterLily.jl](https://github.com/weymouth/WaterLily.jl), a Julia CFD solver using finite-volume and immersed-boundary methods with backend-agnostic execution (CPU/GPU)

We advocate for open science.
Most of the papers have an e-print version you can download for free.
The code is also open source, and you can find them in [GitHub](https://github.com/b-fg).
Please feel free to get in touch for questions, suggestions, or collaborations.
